This is a React app using React Router, Vite, and Vitest.
It also makes use of json-server as a simple backend.

Built following a tutorial with some of my own modifications.

## Getting Started

Be sure you have npm installed.

Then cd into the api folder and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then cd into the client folder and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You should then be able to navigate to http://localhost:5173/ to view the app.

## Testing

To run tests, cd into the client folder and run:

```bash
npm run test
```
